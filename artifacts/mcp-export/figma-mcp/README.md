# Figma MCP Server

A [ModelContextProtocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Figma files. This server provides tools for viewing, commenting, and analyzing Figma designs directly through the ModelContextProtocol.

## Features

- Add a Figma file to your chat with Claude by providing the url
- Read and post comments on Figma files

## Setup with Claude

1. Download and install Claude desktop app from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)

2. Get a Figma API Key (figma.com -> click your name top left -> settings -> Security). Grant `File content` and `Comments` scopes.

2. Configure Claude to use the Figma MCP server. If this is your first MCP server, run the following in terminal.

```bash
echo '{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["figma-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}' > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

If it's not, copy the `figma-mcp` block to your `claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. Look for the hammer icon with the number of available tools in Claude's interface to confirm the server is running.

## Example usage

Start a new chat with claude desktop and paste the following

```
What's in this figma file?

## Development Setup

### Running with Inspector

For development and debugging purposes, you can use the MCP Inspector tool. The Inspector provides a visual interface for testing and monitoring MCP server interactions.

Visit the [Inspector documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) for detailed setup instructions and usage guidelines.

The command to test locally with Inspector is
```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx figma-mcp
```

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```
4. For development with auto-rebuilding:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Available Tools

The server provides the following tools:

- `add_figma_file`: Add a Figma file to your context by providing its URL
